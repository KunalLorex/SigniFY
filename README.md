# SIGNify

## Purpose:

This app is an interface where deaf and non-deaf people can easily understand sign language through a graphical context.

## Usage & Current Functionality:

To use the application is simple - they have to point the camera to the sign language speaker, and the application will output the text in real time. As a mobile application, users will be able to translate sign language anytime anywhere.

### Home Page

The flutter app has three options for the user on the home page (Login, Register, and Continue as Guest). If the user would like to save and view their history, they would need to authenticated with the application.

### Login and Register

Users can simply use their email and password to register an account. In the backend, a new firebase user will be created using that information.
When the user logs in with their credentials, the app will receive an unique userid that can be used to retrive relevant information from the backend.
 
### Camera Page

This page allows to record and convert sign language displayed by a person into text that the user can read in real time. The square box will change color to provide feedback based on the confidence score and display helpful messages like "Keep Steady for accurate results".

### Settings Page

Here users are able to customize different options for theme, color, and font-size. They can also perform login/logout actions from settings.
